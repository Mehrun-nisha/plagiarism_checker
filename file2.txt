Messi

In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga 
(the country’s highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds 
(67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control 
of the ball, Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was 
granted Spanish citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona. 
The next year Messi and Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.
